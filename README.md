## Scoring and time estimates

| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| HackerRank               | 54 / 3 = 18    | 30 min                   |
| Building a Rails Project | 30             | 45 min                   |

A detailed breakdown of the point values within each component is available in
the instructions for the component. The maximum number of points for this entire
evaluation is **48**. Your final score will be calculated as the percentage of
